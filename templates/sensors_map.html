        On the webpage there are maps ang charts showing air pollution, measured by sensors connected to Raspberry Pi. <br>
        From the maps and charts user can see its possible dependencies from other atmospheric conditions.
        For now, there is used only one set of Raspberry Pi + sensors, but there will be more in different points of the city. <br>
        Map of all the sensors is available below. <br>
        More details about the sensor data will be available after <a href="/login">logging in</a>. <br><br>
